- What is single ton class?
    > A Singleton class in Java allows only one instance to be created and provides global access to all other classes through this single object or instance. Similar to the static fields, The instance fields(if any) of a class will occur only for a single time. [Learn more](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/singleton-class-java/)
    
- What is the difference between architectural and design patters?
    > Architecture comes in Designing phase and Design Patterns comes in Building phase. Architectural pattern is like a blue print and design pattern is actual implementation. Architecture is base which everything else adhere to and design pattern is a way to structure classes to solve common problems. [Learn more](https://singhdivesh.medium.com/according-to-wikipedia-b1afa6de08c#:~:text=Architecture%20comes%20in%20Designing%20phase,classes%20to%20solve%20common%20problems.)

## Interview 4 - [Interview Date - 1st Nov 2021] 

- What is Memory Leak and How to find Memory Leaks? 
    > A garbage collector runs periodically to check objects that are not in use and removes them.

[Learne more](https://instabug.com/blog/how-to-fix-android-memory-leaks/)

- How to communicate between two apps?
    - > There are two different ways for apps to interact on Android: via intents, passing data from one application to another; and through services, where one application provides functionality for others to use. [Leanr more](https://digital.ai/catalyst-blog/communicating-between-android-apps)

- What is Method Overloading and Method Overriding?
    > **Overloading** occurs when two or more methods in one class have the same method name but different parameters.
    **Overriding** occurs when two methods have the same method name and parameters. One of the methods is in the parent class, and the other is in the child   class. Overriding allows a child class to provide the specific implementation of a method that is already present in its parent class.[Learne more](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/overloading-vs-overriding)

- What is the difference between Hashmap and Hashtable. [Learne more](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-between-hashmap-and-hashtable-in-java/)

- What is the difference between MVC, MVP and MVVM. 
    > Both MVP and MVVM are derivatives of MVC. The key difference between MVC and its derivatives is the dependency each layer has on other layers, as well as how tightly bound they are to each other. ... MVVM attempts to avoid these issues. In MVP, the role of the controller is replaced with a Presenter. [Learne more](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-javascript-design/9781449334840/ch10s09.html)
- What is Data binding?
    > The Data Binding Library is an Android Jetpack library that allows you to bind UI components in your XML layouts to data sources in your app using a    declarative format rather than programmatically, reducing boilerplate code. [Learne more](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding)
- What is PendingIntent?
    > A PendingIntent is a token that you give to a foreign application (e.g. NotificationManager, AlarmManager, Home Screen AppWidgetManager, or other 3rd party applications), which allows the foreign application to use your application's permissions to execute a predefined piece of code.
